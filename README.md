# FirstCPrograms
My first C programs. Don't judge me; i'll get my TI-83...

These programs were made using knowledge collected from KNR volume 2, a book created by ANSI to make a comprehensive interpretation of C. 
Don't take this as a joke; it is purely intended to keep my C programs in a timeline.After all, that's what Git is intended for, right?

Made using Emacs and too much StackOverFlow.

Remember to bring a towel.
